# Python Basics to Advanced – Practice Repository

A structured and continuously evolving collection of my Python practice assignments, starting from foundational concepts and progressing toward advanced topics.

This repository serves as a documented learning journey where I build strong Python fundamentals through consistent coding practice and structured problem-solving.

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to strengthening core Python concepts through hands-on implementation.

It contains:

- Concept-based coding assignments
- Logical problem-solving exercises
- Experiments with indexing and slicing
- Loop control practice (break / continue)
- Conditional logic building
- Progressive topic-wise structure

The content will be updated regularly as I move from basic concepts to more advanced Python programming.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/Rafhy-Khan/python_basics.git


2. Navigate into the project directory:



cd python_basics


3. Run any Python file:



python filename.py


Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

## Repository Philosophy

Strong fundamentals create strong systems.

This repository reflects a disciplined and structured approach toward mastering Python programming from the ground up.

The goal is not just to write code, but to deeply understand how Python works internally and how logical thinking is applied to solve problems.
